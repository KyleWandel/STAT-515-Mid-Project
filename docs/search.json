This process should help you identify unique patterns or information that were not initially evident.\nAdditionally, you are expected to compare and analyze the strengths and weaknesses of both the original plot and your redesigns, considering the context.\nThe redesign project includes, updating your website with the redesigned project, accompanied by a 10minute oral video presentation embedded on your website."

    "text": "I am currently a Manager of industry analysis and business intelligence for the Consumer Technology Association (CTA). My primary role for CTA is to oversee and manage our forecast data program. Using both internal and external data sets, I create various reports and analysis to help the industry in a variety of ways. I would consider myself an expert in how the technology industry/market is performing from a sales perpesctive and how emerging technologies and trends are impacting the industry.\nI live in Fairfax, VA with my wonderful wife Courtney and our 3 incredibly cuddly and anxious animals. We have two dogs, Buddy and Maximus and a cat named Bentley.\nI am an avid sports enthusiast and probably know the sports world more than I do the technology industry. My favorite sport to watch, talk, analyze and write about is football, but I really love all sports.\nAnalyzing and tracking data has always been a passion of mine and I incorporate it in everything that I do. From pacing and tracking my times training for triathlons to arguing about sports, I believe data is the key to everything."

The graph was criticized so badly that they took it down shortly after publishing it. However, it was up long enough for everyone to see the poorly constructed figure and it is now often used to depict horrible graphics.\nThe data that Reuters used is from Florida’s Department of Law Enforcement and is created by Criminal Justice Analytics Bureau. The report is an annual report that aggregates all crime that occurred in the state of Florida. There are numerous reports created by the bureau, including type of offense, location, and by weapon type, which is where the data from the graph comes from."
